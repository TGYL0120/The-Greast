<h2>People's history</h2><strong><p>Steven Paul Jobs
</strong> </p>Paul Jobs bought a used car at the same time as a salesman, repaired it,
<br>and resold it to Steve Jobs to pass on his passion for the machine.
<br> This later becomes Jobs' product philosophy.
<br> But Jobs didn't really show much interest in handling the machine.
<br>At that time, California was hit by a boom in the munitions industry,
<br> and it became a high-tech area. Under the influence,
<br> Jobs developed an interest in engineering
<br>by asking various questions to the adults in the neighborhood

<p style="margin-top:50px;"><p><strong> Elon Reeve Musk</strong> </p> Musk has been a great reader since he was a child.
<br>He was used to learning by himself through books,
<br>and at the age of 12, he mastered computer programming himself to create a game called Blaster.
<br> The game is a virtual space game inspired by a sci-fi novel by Musk,
<br> which also unveiled its source code for $500 from a magazine company called PC and office technology.
<br> Musk, unlike other children, had excellent memory and preferred to read books rather
<br>than play with friends.
<br> As a result, he was ostracized by his friends around him. Tesla was founded in 2003  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br> while attending high school and received offers for acquisition and employment from Microsoft
<br> and AOL, but turned down the offer and entered Harvard University in September 2002. In 2004,

<br> their connections with friends, and expanded the list of applicants to universities across the U.S.,
<br>including Stanford and Columbia. Since then, anyone from around the world has been allowed to
<br>join Facebook, with the number of Facebook subscribers reaching 2.3 billion as of 2019.
